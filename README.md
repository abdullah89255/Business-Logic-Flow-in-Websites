# Business-Logic-Flow-in-Websites
Great question 👌 Let’s break it down step by step.

## 🔹 What is **Business Logic Flow** in Websites?

**Business Logic** = the rules, processes, and workflows that define **how a website or application should behave**.
It ensures that users interact with the application as intended, according to business rules.

👉 For example:

* In an **e-commerce site**, a rule might be:
  “A discount coupon can only be applied once per order.”
* In an **online banking system**, a rule might be:
  “A user can only transfer funds if their balance ≥ transfer amount.”

**Business Logic Flaw (BLF)** happens when attackers exploit weaknesses in these rules or workflows to achieve something unintended (without hacking servers, just abusing logic).

## 🔹 Examples of Business Logic Flaw Vulnerabilities

1. **Bypassing Payment Steps**

   * Attacker modifies request to skip the “payment success” step and still gets the product.

2. **Coupon / Discount Abuse**

   * Applying the same coupon multiple times by manipulating requests.

3. **Password Reset Logic**

   * If reset tokens aren’t invalidated properly, attackers can reuse them.

4. **Race Condition in Purchases**

   * Adding the same product multiple times before stock updates, buying more than available.

5. **Privilege Escalation**

   * Normal user accessing admin-only endpoints by guessing URLs (e.g., `/admin/dashboard`).

## 🔹 How to Find Business Logic Flaws

Unlike SQLi or XSS, there are **no automated scanners** that reliably detect logic flaws — they require **manual testing + critical thinking**.

### ✅ Steps:

1. **Understand the Application Workflow**

   * Walk through as a normal user. Identify steps like: login → add to cart → checkout → payment → confirmation.

2. **Think Like an Attacker**

   * What happens if I:

     * Skip a step?
     * Repeat a step?
     * Tamper with parameters (price, user ID, coupon)?
     * Do actions out of order?

3. **Test Input Manipulation**

   * Modify hidden fields, API calls, or request bodies.
     Example: Change `"price": 100` to `"price": 1`.

4. **Look for Broken State Management**

   * Does the app validate transitions?
     Example: Can I directly access `/checkout` without adding items to cart?

5. **Check Role & Permission Enforcement**

   * Try accessing other users’ data or admin features.

## 🔹 How to Fix Business Logic Flaws

1. **Enforce Server-Side Validation**

   * Don’t trust client-side checks (JavaScript/cart totals).
   * Always re-check actions on the backend.

2. **Implement Strict Workflow Validation**

   * Ensure users cannot skip or reorder critical steps.
   * Example: Payment must be **verified before** shipping.

3. **Use Strong Session & State Management**

   * Track order states in DB, not just cookies or hidden fields.

4. **Enforce Rate Limits & Uniqueness**

   * Prevent repeated coupon use, race conditions, or brute force.

5. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**

   * Validate user permissions for each action, not just at login.

6. **Thorough Testing**

   * Conduct manual **business logic penetration testing**.
   * Use test cases for misuse/abuse scenarios.

✅ **In short:**
Business logic flaws exploit the *intended workflow* of a site, not technical vulnerabilities.
To find them, you need to analyze workflows, break rules intentionally, and see if the system prevents abuse.
To fix, enforce **server-side validation, workflow integrity, and permission checks**.
